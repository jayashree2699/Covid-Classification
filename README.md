# Q-Levy FlightPSO interleaved DCGAN and Convolutional XGBOOST Classifier for Augmenting and Diagnosing COVID-19 CT images
A Q-learning tempered levy Particle Swarm Optimization (Q-LFPSO) interleaved Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Convolutional Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) classifier for augmenting and diagnosing COVID 19 CT images. Q- LFPSO uses a hybrid combination of metaheuristic reward-penalty optimization based on levy flight for training DCGAN to generate augmented CT images.
